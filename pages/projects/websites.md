# React and responsive websites

shaddok (react)
virage-Ã©nergie (react)

As a contractor, on my own or for design agency ClDesign, I created high-end responsive websites for clients in Architecture, Travel and Design.

Front-end
- Careful responsive design (s1: tandala mobile / desktop versions, s2: kaleidoscopeye complex breakpoints, s3: chloe bodart fun logo with designer)
- Custom js work (s4: open in grid for locomotion, s5: advanced keyboard + mouse navigation with tandala)
- shaddok landscape and portrait mode (s6)

- React (Isomorphic)
- Redux
- HTML5
- CSS3
- jQuery
- Modernizr
- SEO friendly HTML semantics

Back-end
- WordPress custom post types and fields (using ACF)
- WordPress Rest Api
- Clean interface for content editors (s6)
