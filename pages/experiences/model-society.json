Inspired by his vision, I jumped in full-time as lead designer.</p><p>From initial wireframes to final UI mockups, as well as designing the logo and visual identity, I set out to create the most beautiful interface we could envision.</p><p>Development was handed to a remote team in Canada, and I played an instrumental part in providing them with detailed specs and directions up to launch.</p><p>Since my part ended, the website has grown to thousands of members (artists) and tens of thousands of active users.</p>",
