# Model Society
product design, ux/ui design, strategy

In 2011, my friend David Bollt wanted to create the social network he, as an artist, had always dreamed of.

Inspired by his vision, I jumped in full-time from the beginning of the project, as lead designer.

From the simplest sketches to details on UI buttons, I gave everything I had to create the most beautiful and easy to use website we could dream of.

Development was handed to a remote team in Canada, and I played an instrumental part in providing them with detailed specs and direction for the duration of development.

Since my part ended, the website has grown to thousands of members (artists) and tens of thousands of active users.
