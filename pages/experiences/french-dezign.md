Having acquired valuable skills as a webdesigner and developer in high school (I basically spent all my free time learning and working on web projects), I was feeling uninterested by what college had to offer.

Shortly after dropping out, a client offered me to become his co-founder for his ecommerce venture in Moscow. I moved there in the next few weeks.

When I arrived, the website was totaling between 5 and 10 orders per months, clearly not enough for a $30 product.

Being directly interested in our success, I set out to learn and do everything I could to help us reach higher revenue. In addition to web development, I wanted to master how to build and grow and online business:
- I redesigned and rebuilt the website to make it more in touch with Russians tastes and habits(after studying them), which improved time spent on the site
- I conducted a/b testing on the shopping cart to understand why we were losing so many users before they could complete their order, and fixed it to see a 200% increase in conversion
- I conducted a seo strategy (web media outreach and link building) that put us first on the leading search engine (Yandex) for our main keyword
- I created an email subscription program, that had people sign up for free decoration advice (the site sold decorative goods), and sent them cool free stuff every 3-4 days until they ordered (and they did!)

In 8 months, the website grew from a monthly revenue of $300 to $12,000.

As the 2008 crisis hit however, Visas became hard to come-by and we were almost forced to leave the country overnight! Our main competitor (totaling around 5000 physical point-of-sale in the country) was eager to acquire those who had beaten him in the search results. It was a great way to end the adventure :)
