As a 16 year old kid I was stoked!</p><p>For the next season, I prepared a more advanced website, with user comments, ratings and videos for all candidates. Unfortunately, the network sent me a cease and disist letter right after launch. They had finally decided to offer their own video on demand service :).</p>",
