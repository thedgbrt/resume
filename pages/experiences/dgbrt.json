This would automatically generate lots of medium quality links to my website, enough to beat the competition.</p><p>The website ended up ranking number 3 for the \"webdesigner\" keyword at the national level for a few months (1st in my region), which led dozens of prospects to call me every month and offer me work.</p><p>After working with different types of businesses, I found my sweet spot by partnering with design agencies. I just loved to be able to trust other people with design, and only focus on producing high quality code for them.</p>",
