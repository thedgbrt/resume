I opened my own consulting firm in France in 2013, with a focus on product design and development.

To get lots of clients quickly, I set out to grab a spot in the top results of Google for the "webdesigner" search term.

The strategy was simple: create a design that was remarkable enough to get the attention of css design galleries. This would automatically generate lots of medium quality links to my website, enough to beat the competition.

The website ended up ranking number 3 for the "webdesigner" keyword at the national level for a few months (1st in my region), which led dozens of prospects to call me every month and offer me work.

After working with different types of businesses, I found my sweet spot by partnering with design agencies. I just loved to be able to trust other people with design, and only focus on producing high quality code for them.

The website I had created is still online, and shows some of my previous work as a designer too: http://www.dgbrt.fr
