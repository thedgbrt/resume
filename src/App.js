        <h1>Dagobert Renouf, 27 - Front-end Engineer</h1>

        <p>I make <strong>responsive websites and apps</strong>. I'm fluent in <strong>React + Redux</strong>.</p>

        <p>Here are some things I made:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>La Chronique (details) [React native app]</li>
          <li>Euratalent (details) [responsive web app]</li>
          <li>Locomotion, Tandala, Kaleidoscopeye, Chloe bodart (details) [responsive</li> websites]
          <li>Virage Ã‰nergie, Shaddok (details) [React websites]</li>
        </ul>

        <p>Building websites since I was 15, I have acquired a <strong>broad set of skills</strong> as <strong>founder</strong>, <strong>co-founder</strong> and contractor:</p>

        <ul>
          <li>In 2006, in high school, I <strong>created my first website that made money</strong> (details)</li>
          <li>In 2008, I dropped out of college and <strong>moved to Moscow to grow an e-commerce website</strong> (details)</li>
          <li>In 2011 and 2012, I <strong>led design at ModelSociety</strong> (details)</li>
          <li>Since 2013, I've run my own consulting business that helped companies and design agencies with <strong>development, strategy and product design</strong> (details)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>These experiences have made me <strong>autonomous</strong>, <strong>self-driven</strong> and capable of <strong>leading ambitious product goals</strong>.</p>

        <p>Involved in <strong>product, design and marketing</strong> decisions, I keep the bottom line in mind. When time to ship a feature runs out, I <strong>find creative ways to keep moving forward</strong>.</p>

        <p>The practice of <strong>NVC </strong>(details), coupled with my knowledge of <strong>the Enneagram and Spiral Dynamics </strong>(details) further improve my capacity to <strong>facilitate communication and progress</strong> between all members of a team.</p>

        <p>If you are creating a culture of <strong>curiosity, ambition and constant learning</strong>, then we might be a winning combo.</p>
